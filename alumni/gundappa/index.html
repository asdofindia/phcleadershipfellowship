<h1>Dr Gundappa S Havalakod</h1>
<p class="h5 text-muted">Medical officer at Primary health center, Gumballi.</p>
<div class=float-end><img src=/images/gundappa.jpg height=200 width=200></div>
<p>Being from Ramdurg Belgaum, he finished his primary and highschool education in his hometown and college in Alvas Mangalore and graduated with MBBS from Mandya Institute of Medical Sciences in 2019 and has been working as a medical officer at Gumballi since then.</p>
<p>He loves being part of public health practice in terms of providing primary, secondary, and preventive care through field workers. Also to directly involve himself in the community trying to find out the actual causes of diseases and suffering in the community.</p>
<p>He believes that “A doctor has many roles rather than just treating. Educating the public, guiding them, counseling them and importantly being a leader and addressing the issues that are leading to diseases and morbidity and mortality”.</p>
