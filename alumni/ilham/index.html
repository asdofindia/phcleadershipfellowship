<p>Having completed MBBS from Bangalore Medical College, Ilhaam has a keen interest in furthering healthcare access in resource-limited settings, and health system - strengthening for underserved communities. She believes quality, patient-centric and contextual primary care is the backbone of any successful community-based healthcare initiative. Having worked to set up a rural community clinic in the remote tribal village of Ijeirong, Manipur, she is currently in transition to work on an HIV/TB/HCV project in the same State. Living with the community she works with has always been a great source of motivation and learning for her as a medical professional.</p>
<p>When asked about her learnings from Primary Care Practise she says: “One should be willing to take out some time to understand a patient’s needs and concerns by hearing them out. Feeling heard and respected often opens up doctor-patient communication especially in contexts where access to healthcare has been limited at best. Patient autonomy should always be respected and fostered through discussing the rationale behind a possible diagnosis, prescription or test. This goes a long way in creating a more health-informed community, strengthens trust and supports patient compliance and better health outcomes.”</p>
