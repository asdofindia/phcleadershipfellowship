He has three years of experience and loves working in underserved communities to bring positive health outcomes in the population in which he serves. He desires to decrease disease burden overall year by year and not just treat patient illnesses. He says, “working in primary care is satisfactory and rewarding.  It brings fulfilment in life. Patients know you and you also know many of them. Healthcare delivery is best when you know the patient because you tailor treatment according to the patient.”
