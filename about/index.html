<h1>About</h1>
<p>We know that high quality primary health care is essential to the well-being of the individual and community. The AFPI-Karuna Trust Primary Care Leadership Fellowship was created in 2019 to improve primary health care in rural and urban areas of India. Our vision is to strengthen the training of primary care physicians to realize their full potential as community leaders in addressing the social determinants of health as well as promotive, preventive, curative, and rehabilitative care.</p>
<p>Using the zoom platform and the ECHO model, we meet weekly for two hours to discuss various topics in a case-based format. Our fellowship focuses on cultivating leadership skills in advocacy, population health, practice management, and quality improvement. We also hope to inspire life-long learning in evidence-based and patient-oriented practices. Complementary to the weekly discussions, we hope to arrange in-person skills workshops and educational seminars with our institutional partners throughout the year.</p>
<p>We recognize the important work already being done day to day by compassionate and talented medical officers in the primary health centers. Our hope is to equip them with the mentorship, network, and tools for them to provide the highest quality of health care possible and ultimately improve health outcomes for their communities.</p>
<h2 id=vision>VISION</h2>
<p>The vision of the certificate program is to improve the training of the next generation of leaders in primary care in India and to inspire those physicians to develop practices that address all aspects of comprehensive primary care including promotive, preventive, curative, and rehabilitative.</p>
<p>The long-term vision of the program is to grow into a critical component of post-graduate training for all physicians in India planning on providing primary care.</p>
<h2 id=the-need-for-primary-care-training>THE NEED FOR PRIMARY CARE TRAINING</h2>
<p>India produces approximately 50,000 medical doctors (MBBS) every year. <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4408692/>There are less than 20,000 formal post-graduate positions in the country</a>. As a result, many MBBS graduates who wish to complete further training spend significant time after completion of their coursework studying for postgraduate entrance exams, working in jobs as resident medical officers focusing on clinical care, or they leave medicine altogether and pursue alternate means of employment. Few MBBS doctors start primary care practices, likely due to a lack of exposure to role models, lack of confidence, and the feeling that sufficient skills are lacking.</p>
<p>Comprehensive primary care is defined by the <a href=https://www.who.int/teams/social-determinants-of-health/declaration-of-alma-ata>Alma-Ata Declaration of 1978</a> in providing promotive, preventive, curative, and rehabilitative care for all members of a community. Though community medicine is a part of the <a href=https://www.aiims.edu/aiims/academic/aiims-syllabus/Syllabus%20-%20MBBS.pdf>MBBS curriculum</a> currently, there is less emphasis on applying these concepts once practicing as opposed to seeing patients in direct clinical care.</p>
<p>The proposed certificate program does not aim to compete with currently established MD or DNB courses. Instead, it aims to streamline and augment the learning and capacity of young doctors immediately after their MBBS into a formal and mentored development program. At the end of the program, the participants will have a broad range of clinical, research, and leadership skills.</p>
<h2 id=certificate-program-preparatory-work>CERTIFICATE PROGRAM PREPARATORY WORK</h2>
<p>Though there is data supporting the need for further training in comprehensive primary care, it is clear from review of MBBS syllabi that these concepts are present in the undergraduate medical training. Further research should be completed prior to implementation of the program to ascertain those barriers that exist to MBBS graduates engaging with comprehensive primary care principles.</p>
<h2 id=training-site>TRAINING SITE</h2>
<p>The primary clinical focus will be on outpatient care in partnership with a KT-managed PHC as the medical home for the fellows. Didactics and further training will be completed either online through the <a href=https://hsc.unm.edu/echo/about-us/>ECHO model</a> and self-directed learning or be provided through in-person sessions at the Karuna Trust offices or the PHC.</p>
<h2 id=training-description>TRAINING DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>The aim of the certificate program is to continue the training of MBBS graduates in learning the concepts and implementation of comprehensive, full-spectrum primary care. In clinical training, the participants will work as a medical officer in a PHC, addressing the needs of their patient population while using the concepts of empathetic primary care. Participants will bring complex cases for presentation to faculty, identifying all of the <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1466742/>biopsychosocial factors</a> contributing to that case.</p>
<p>Apart from these clinical skills, the certificate program aims to provide significant training in leadership, advocacy, research, and community engagement. Training sessions will focus on addressing those aspects of the Alma-Ata declaration that have been left behind, identifying ways that participants can engage in promotive, preventive, and rehabilitative services. The program will focus on the wellness of the community served by the PHC and require participants to develop projects that look to address these needs. Examples of concepts that will be highlighted throughout the program include community needs assessments, empathetic care, rational drug use, and community wellness.</p>
<p>At the completion of the program, participants will be well-prepared to identify and address all factors that contribute to the wellness of their community. They will have the skills, knowledge, and inquisitive nature that will allow them to provide care at the highest level, incorporating an interdisciplinary team to provide comprehensive primary health care.</p>
